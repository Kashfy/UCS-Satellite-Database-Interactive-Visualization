# UCS-Satellite-Database-Interactive-Visualization
A small project that I worked on in my Data Science class. An interactive visualization that I made in the programming language R; utilizing the packages Rshiny, Dplyr, ggplot2, and maps. This visualization displays the satellites launched into space by various countries or entities, and the user can filter countries, classes of orbit, and more.
